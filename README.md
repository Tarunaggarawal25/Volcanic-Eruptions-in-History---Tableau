# Volcanic-Eruptions-in-History---Tableau

This is a Tableau dashboard that provides visualizations and insights into volcanic eruptions around the world using the Smithsonian Volcanic Eruptions dataset. The dashboard is built using Tableau, a popular data visualization tool, and aims to help users understand and analyze the patterns and characteristics of volcanic eruptions throughout history.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this dashboard is the Smithsonian Volcanic Eruptions dataset, which contains information about volcanic eruptions from 4360 BCE to the present day. The dataset is publicly available and can be obtained from Kaggle. The dashboard is designed to provide visualizations and insights based on the specific attributes and patterns observed in this dataset.
